# VOICE CHANGER

A voice changer is a nifty tool that alters the pitch of a person's voice, giving you the power to make it higher (increasing the pitch) or lower (decreasing the pitch). This pitch adjustment works by tinkering with the frequency of the sound waves produced when speaking. 🗣️ When the pitch goes up, the voice takes on a more high-pitched tone, mimicking a higher frequency. On the flip side, lowering the pitch results in a deeper, lower-toned voice, simulating a lower frequency. 🎶 Voice changers achieve this cool effect by playing with the frequency and timing of the audio signals, crafting a distorted or transformed version of the original voice. 🔄🔊

# REVERSAL

A reverse effect in audio adds a unique touch by playing the audio content backward, producing a distinct and often surreal sound. 🔄 The audio file undergoes processing, causing the waveform to play in the reverse order of its original sequence.

When the reversed audio is played, it can create unexpected and distinctive sounds. Reversed music, speech, or other audio elements often carry an eerie or otherworldly quality. 🎶 In some cases, artists or producers get creative by embedding hidden messages or Easter eggs in their audio content, incorporating reversed elements that reveal something interesting when played backward. 🕵️‍♂️🔊
