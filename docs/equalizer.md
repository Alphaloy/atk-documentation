# ADVANCED EDIT & RECORD

In both sections, you'll find numerous tools designed to enhance audio effects significantly. The advanced editing option lets you apply EQ effects to pre-recorded audio, while the recording feature offers similar capabilities but for audio captured on the go. 

For the best results, ensure your recordings are made in a quiet environment with a quality microphone.

 Now, let's explore the Equalizer audio techniques together

## a.Bass

Bass refers to the lower frequencies in the sound spectrum. In music, bass is associated with deep, low tones and is responsible for providing richness and depth to the overall sound. 🎵 Bass frequencies typically range from about 20 Hz to 250 Hz. Below this range, you might feel the vibrations more than hear them, and above this range, the sound becomes more midrange or treble. 🕺🥁 Bass frequencies are prominent in instruments like the bass guitar, double bass, and bass drums. 🎸🎶

*There are two general classifications of bass*:

**Sub-bass** refers to the very low-frequency range, typically below 60 Hz, and it provides the deep rumbling sounds, like those you might feel in your chest during a powerful movie scene or a bass-heavy music track.  Eg: EDM , HipHop

**Mid-bass**, on the other hand, includes frequencies above the sub-bass range, typically around 60 Hz to 250 Hz. Mid-bass frequencies add body and warmth to the sound, providing the thump in bass drums and the punch in bass guitars.

### User Guide :
Adjusting the bass value using the knob in a clockwise direction will result in enhancing the overall bass in a combined manner. This augmentation contributes to a richer and fuller sound, emphasizing both the deep sub-bass frequencies, creating a profound sense of depth, and the mid-bass frequencies, adding warmth and body to the music. 

On the flip side, reducing the bass by turning the knob counterclockwise leads to a decrease in bass levels. This reduction de-emphasizes the low frequencies, making the music sound hollower and thinner, as it lacks the deep resonance and warmth associated with enhanced bass.

In summary, manipulating the bass knob clockwise enriches the audio experience, while turning it counterclockwise diminishes the bass, resulting in a less robust sound.

## b. Treble
Treble, in the realm of music and audio, refers to the higher range of musical sound frequencies. 🎶 Typically spanning from about 2,000 Hz to 20,000 Hz (2 kHz to 20 kHz), the treble range encompasses instruments like high-pitched vocals, cymbals, flutes, and the higher notes on a piano or guitar.

Adjusting the treble in audio systems means highlighting or toning down these higher frequencies to boost the clarity and brightness of the sound. 🎚️ Treble provides the ability to finely tune sound quality, catering to diverse preferences and various listening environments. 🌟🔊

*The treble frequencies are classified into 4* : 

**Sub-Treble** : Frequency Range: 2,000 Hz - 4,000 Hz (2 kHz - 4 kHz) . The lower part of the treble range, including higher-pitched vocals and some overtones of musical instruments.

**Mid-Treble** :Frequency Range: 4,000 Hz - 8,000 Hz (4 kHz - 8 kHz). The middle part of the treble range, incorporating the majority of vocal sibilance (high-frequency consonant sounds) and many high-pitched instruments like violins and flutes.

**High-Treble** :Frequency Range: 8,000 Hz - 12,000 Hz (8 kHz - 12 kHz). The upper part of the treble range, including the shimmer of cymbals, the brilliance of brass instruments, and very high-frequency harmonics of various instruments.

**Super-Treble**:Frequency Range: 12,000 Hz - 20,000 Hz (12 kHz - 20 kHz) . The highest part of the audible frequency spectrum, including the very high harmonics of certain instruments and some electronic sounds.

### User Guide :
Adjusting the treble value using the knob in a clockwise direction not only enhances the music experience but also refines its quality to perfection. As you turn the knob in a clockwise motion, the music becomes more vibrant and alive. It meticulously fine-tunes every treble frequency, resulting in a sound that is not just crisp and clear, but also rich in detail. This adjustment creates a crystal-clear sense of sharpness, bringing out the subtle nuances of the audio and improving harmonics to an extraordinary level.

Conversely, when the knob is turned in an anti-clockwise direction, it delicately reduces the treble value. This reduction plays a crucial role in eliminating any excess chilling sound, ensuring a smoother transition between different musical elements. By diminishing the sharpness of the audio file, this adjustment makes the music more mellower, creating a warm and inviting ambiance that envelops the listener. The result is a harmonious blend of sounds, offering an different auditory experience to the listeners.

## c. Pitch

Pitch refers to the perceived frequency of a sound wave and is one of the auditory sensations that humans experience. 🎵 It is a subjective attribute of sound, meaning it is related to how we perceive the frequency of a sound wave. In simpler terms, pitch determines how high or low a sound is. 🎶 Sounds with a high pitch have a high frequency, meaning the sound waves vibrate rapidly, while sounds with a low pitch have a low frequency, indicating slower vibrations. Pitch perception is essential in music, speech, and various other auditory activities, allowing us to distinguish between different sounds and tones. 🎤 Pitch is measured in Hertz (Hz), where one Hertz represents one cycle per second of a sound wave. 

### User Guide :
Turning the knobs to the left makes the sound deeper and heavier by lowering the pitch. It's like slowing down the vibrations in the sound wave, creating a rich, resonant tone. This change is often used in music to make certain sounds feel more serious or emotional.

On the other hand, turning the knob to the right makes the sound higher and sharper by increasing the pitch. It's like speeding up the vibrations, producing a lively, energetic tone. Higher-pitched sounds are commonly linked to excitement, tension, or alertness in music. These adjustments give different moods to the music, making it either deep and heavy or lively and energetic.

## d. Tempo
Tempo refers to the speed at which a piece of music is played. It is a fundamental aspect of music that determines the pace or rhythm of a musical composition. 🎶 Tempo is usually measured in beats per minute (BPM), indicating the number of beats or pulses in a minute.

Common tempo markings include allegro (fast and lively), moderato (moderate speed), and adagio (slow and stately), among others. 🕺💃 The tempo greatly influences the mood and emotional impact of a musical piece, playing a crucial role in shaping the overall musical experience for the listeners. 🎵✨

### User Guide :
A slower tempo, represented by fewer beats per minute can be achieved by turning knob to left which in turn creates a relaxed, unhurried ambiance in the music. It feels like a gentle, steady pulse, allowing listeners to savor each note and melody. Slower tempos(Adagio) are often associated with calmness and tranquility, evoking a sense of peaceful serenity.

A faster tempo which can be achieved by rotating the knob to right quickens the musical pulse, infusing the composition with energy and vitality. The beats come rapid-fire, propelling the music forward with an infectious enthusiasm. A swift tempo often brings excitement, urgency, and a feeling of exhilaration and a sense of adventure and liveliness.

## e. Echo

An echo is a fascinating sound effect created when sound waves bounce off surfaces like walls, mountains, or buildings, returning to the listener's ears after a noticeable delay. 🗣️ This delay between the initial sound and its reflection tricks our ears into perceiving an echo.

Echoes are not just auditory quirks; they serve a purpose by adding a sense of spaciousness and depth to the listening experience. 🌌 They can reverberate through canyons, giving a natural ambiance, or be harnessed in architecture for artistic or practical reasons. Echoes play a unique role in both enhancing our auditory encounters and contributing to the creative aspects of sound. 🎶🌍

### User Guide :
When you increase the echo using the knob control, you're enhancing the intensity or prolonging the duration of the reflected sound. This would result in a pronounced and prolonged echo, resembling a powerful reverberation filling the space. This adjustment is often used to add spaciousness and depth to audio, making it sound grand, immersive, and dramatic.

#### Important Reminder:
"It is crucial to note that amplifying the echo in pre-coded audio files may lead to the cancellation of the existing echo effect, potentially diminishing the overall audio quality. To safeguard your project's integrity, it is advisable to preview your edited audio meticulously using the designated preview icon before initiating the export process. This precautionary step ensures that the intended echo effect is preserved and that the final output meets the desired standards of excellence."

## f. Fade

"Fading" is a technique that involves the gradual decrease or increase in volume or intensity of a sound or music. 🎶 It's like a gentle transition, making the audio smoothly go from being loud to quiet (fade out) or from silence to getting louder (fade in).

This technique is about skillfully manipulating the audio signal, applicable to individual tracks, entire audio mixes, or specific parts of a recording. It's the secret ingredient for achieving a polished and seamless sound, ensuring that the transitions are smooth and pleasing to the ears. 🔄✨ Fading is a nuanced art in audio production, contributing to the overall finesse of the auditory experience. 🎚️🔊

## g. Reverb

Reverb, a snappy term for reverberation, is the lingering presence of sound in a space even after the initial sound is made. 🎶 It happens when sound waves bounce off surfaces and objects, weaving a complex web of reflections that harmonize.

This enchanting phenomenon, called reverb, does more than just linger—it injects a sense of space, depth, and authenticity into audio recordings. 🌌🔊 The result? A more natural and immersive sound that feels like it's happening right where you are. Reverb isn't a one-size-fits-all; it can mimic various acoustic spaces, transporting the listener to different locations and creating a more captivating listening experience. 🌍✨

### User Guide :
By adjusting the reverb using reverb knob we are gradually adjusting the reflection density , decay time , early reflections , frequency response and pre delay  which will make you feel the sound in specified environment with enhanced depth and realism.

There are various environment listed inside our app namely

**Amphitheatre** 🏟️ : In an amphitheatre, reverb occurs as sound waves reflect off the surrounding structures and natural elements, creating a rich, immersive acoustic environment. The curved design of the amphitheatre enhances reverberation, providing a natural echo that enriches musical performances.

**Classroom** 🏫: In a classroom, reverb is typically minimal due to the presence of absorptive materials such as desks, chairs, and students. However, sound waves can still bounce off hard surfaces like walls and windows, creating a subtle reverberation that affects the clarity of spoken words and music.

**Cathedral** ⛪️: Cathedrals are known for their long reverberation times due to their high ceilings, large open spaces, and hard, reflective surfaces. Sound waves in cathedrals bounce off walls, pillars, and intricate architectural details, resulting in a prolonged reverb that enhances choral music and organ performances.

**Large Church** 🏛️: Similar to cathedrals, large churches feature high ceilings and spacious interiors, leading to significant reverberation. The sound waves reflect off the walls, creating a warm and enveloping reverb that adds depth and resonance to vocal and instrumental music.

**Bathroom** 🚿: Bathrooms typically have hard surfaces like tiles and mirrors, which cause sound waves to bounce around and create a noticeable reverb effect. Musicians sometimes use bathrooms for recording vocals or acoustic instruments to capture the natural reverberation, albeit with a specific character.

**Minster**🏰: Minsters, like cathedrals, provide a grand acoustic environment with substantial reverb. The architectural intricacies and vast space lead to a reverberation that enhances the sound of choirs, orchestras, and other musical performances, creating a majestic auditory experience.

**Slinky** 🌀: Reverb works on a Slinky in a way similar to other environments with hard, reflective surfaces. When sound waves, such as tapping or striking the Slinky, interact with the coils, they bounce off the metal or plastic material, creating reflections. These reflections then collide and overlap with the direct sound, producing a complex pattern of reverberation.
