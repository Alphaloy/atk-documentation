# KARAOKE

## Karaoke Description:

A karaoke music extractor is a tool or software that separates the vocals from the instrumental (music) track in a song. This process is commonly known as vocal isolation or vocal removal. It can be useful for creating karaoke tracks or remixing songs. However, it's important to note that perfect vocal extraction is challenging, and the results can vary depending on the complexity of the original recording.

Advanced techniques of machine learning models, have been employed to analyze and separate vocals from music. These models are trained on large datasets to identify and isolate vocal components, which are based on center channel extraction , phase inversion ,  frequency removal..
