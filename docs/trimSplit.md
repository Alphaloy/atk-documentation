# TRIM

## Trim Description :

"Trim" refers to the process of removing unwanted portions from the beginning, or end of an audio file. This editing technique helps to refine the audio, eliminating any unnecessary or undesired parts, resulting in a cleaner and more polished final product. Trimming is commonly used in music production, podcast editing, and other audio-related tasks to improve the overall quality and flow of the content.

### User Guide :

When you're editing audio, you can use the trim option to remove unwanted parts. After selecting the audio file, you'll find markers at both ends of the audio spectrum. You can adjust these markers to choose the part you want to keep. For more precise editing, there's a Start and End prompt where you can specify the exact timing you want to trim. Once you've made your selection, click the "Next" button at the bottom of the screen. After editing, give your audio file a new title(optional). Finally, export the edited audio to your local storage.
